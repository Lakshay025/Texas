# Texas
This project is made by Lakshay Chauhan. "Texas" is basically based on a voice recoginition. This system has some basic features and most importantly mailing and secondly calendar, where user has the privilege to mail and able to create their required event by providing voice commands. For instance, if we use artificial intelligence we can are able to turn off the lights without the instruction given by the user.  Almost, Everyone has some knowledge about trending voice assistant like cortana for windows, and Siri for apple users, this virtual voice assistants aren’t as brainy and intelligent as Ironman's Jarvis which appear in the superhero movie, but the intended actions are almost similar by virtual voice assistant. It’s like you need a ask question, and within a few fraction of seconds you will get an answer. It’s just give a command and get result.
